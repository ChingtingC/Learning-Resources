## Usage

### Need help!

If you have no ideas to do, just call help!

`git help`

### Set who you are :)

* method 1:

```
cat >> ~/.gitconfig <<\EOF
[user]
	name = Your Name on Git
	email = your-mail@yourdomain.com
EOF
```
* method 2:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name on Git"
git config --global user.email your-mail@yourdomain.com
```

### Create a new repository

Wanna create a whole new repository!

```
mkdir git_repo_test
cd git_repo_test
git init
```

### HEAD, head & branch ... ?

* **branch** is a line of development. A single Git repository can track an arbitrary number of branches.
* **head** is a named reference to the commit at the tip of a branch.
* **HEAD** means the current branch. It is a reference to one of the heads in the repository (except when using a detached HEAD).
* **detached HEAD**: Git allows you to check out an arbitrary commit that isnâ€™t necessarily the tip of any particular branch. The HEAD in such a state is called "detached".

List all branches in the repository

`git branch`

Switch working directory to branch_A

`git switch branch_A`

Create and switch working directory to branch_B

`git branch branch_B`

Delete branch_C

`git branch -d branch_C`


### Get an existing Git repository

If you wanna use an existing repository instead of creating it by yourself, try to git clone!

`git clone git://XXXXX.git`

for example: `git clone git@github.com:ChingtingC/Learning-Resources.git`

### Make something change!

add a new file or update a file

`git add file_test_a.txt`

remove a file

`git rm file_test_b.txt`

leave a message about this change

`git commit`
